description: An Android and iOS mobile app to help coordinate social events, household chores, and payments among your fellow housemates. Our team of 5 learned all the new technologies necessary, designed, and developed this app as our final project within 5 days. Built with a decoupled architecture using Angular and Ionic on the front end, Rails API on the back end. Leveraged Auth0 with Google+ (decoupled OAuth was a big challenge), and Venmo API for payment feature.
